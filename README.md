# Angular View
This is a vscode extension. Inspired by Visual Studio 2017.

### Why
When working with angular/cli, a branch files which base on the component file are created.

Like below:

```
example.component.ts
example.component.spec.ts
example.html
example.css
```

This is not quite easy to organise, while VS 2017 treats those related files as one unit in explorer.
