# Angular Tree Data View
This is a vscode extension.Inspired by Visual Studio 2017.

### What does this consern?
When working with angular/cli, a branch files which base on the component file are created.

```
example.component.ts
example.component.spec.ts
example.html
example.css
```

I want to combine those files into a work unit that displayed in a new tree view in the vscode.

### How to use it
Install it and execute command in the vsode `Show work unit`.
